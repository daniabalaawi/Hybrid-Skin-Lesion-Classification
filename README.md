# Hybrid-Skin-Lesion-Classification
# Hybrid EfficientNet–ViT Feature Fusion for Skin Lesion Classification
This project builds a **hybrid CNN–Transformer** model that fuses **EfficientNet** features with **Vision Transformer (ViT)** embeddings to classify dermoscopic images into multiple lesion types.  
The approach aims to combine **local texture sensitivity** (CNN) with **global context** (ViT) for improved accuracy and interpretability.
